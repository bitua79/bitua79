# Hello, I'm Bita Karvizi! ðŸ‘‹
## About Me
I am an experienced Android developer with three years of expertise at [Part Software Group](https://www.partsoftware.com/), where I developed two industrial applications serving a substantial user base. I   graduated from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (FUM) with my final project being the [Taking Attendance Android Application](https://github.com/bitua79/presence-absence-app). Currently, I am exploring AI-based software development, particularly automated testing in the [Software Quality Lab](https://sqlab.um.ac.ir/index.php?lang=fa).
